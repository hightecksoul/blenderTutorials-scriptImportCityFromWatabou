# Import medieval fantasy cities from Watabou into Blender 3d
This is a very basic script that will allow you to import any city you generated on Watabou to Blender 3d. 

# 1- Visit <a href="https://watabou.github.io/city-generator">Watabou City Generator</a>

# 2- Tweak the settings in the menu to make a unique city

# 3- Export the city as JSON

# 4- Copy the following script
Replace LINK_OF_THE_JSON_FILE by the absolute link to the file you exported from Watabou.

The script will create the collections for buidling, water, farms...

If you have more ideas to include in this script let me know. For example, you can randomize the height of buildings to get a cool city.
I hope this short tutorial was useful to you guys.
# Enjoy!
